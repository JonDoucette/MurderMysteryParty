# MurderMysteryParty
A Murder Mystery website to give out Murder Mystery Character files to players

# Overview
This website utilizing Node.JS helps to host and run Murder Mystery Games without requiring the printing out of pages for each and every user.
In the files contains a list of characters, with those characters, the host can generate random Ids for each of those characters. Then they can give out the Ids to the players that are playing that character. The players will then enter in the ID in order to get their character information.

# Why
After hosting a Murder Mystery party with 32 different players, I realized that there was a huge waste of paper in printing out 2 pages for each player. This gave me an idea to build a quick website that allows for the delivery of character sheets without the need to print out the paper. This worked in my scenario since the players were given all of their character sheets the night of the mystery. This can be adapted to allow for the release of character information prior to the night of the mystery so your players can prepare.

# Lessons Learned
* I am not a designer and website design is not my strongsuit.
* I need more study and practice in Asynchronous programming and JavaScript promises.
* I really enjoy explicit variable types which JavaScript does not have.
* I enjoyed the practice of using two different approaches within the same project based on their strengths (Express and Socket.Io)


# Future Improvements
* Host the website to make publically available.
* Lock the ability for users to view a character sheet if another user is already viewing the character sheet. This can help stop cheating if people get the Ids of other players.
* Improve the website style and design.
* Create a way for users to upload their own character sheets and lists to host more Murder Mysteries.
* Create more anti-cheating measures through locking players from only viewing one character sheet every x days, only allowing one host per game type, etc.
